The text adventure game was completed by implementing a series of interconnected functions that work together to create an interactive gameplay experience. First, input processing functions were added: [remove_punct()](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/jason/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-browser/workbench/workbench.html) strips punctuation while preserving spaces, [remove_spaces()](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/jason/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-browser/workbench/workbench.html) eliminates leading and trailing whitespace, and [normalise_input()](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/jason/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-browser/workbench/workbench.html) chains these together to handle flexible player input like "South!" or "sOuTh...". Display functions were then created to render the game interface: [display_room()](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/jason/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-browser/workbench/workbench.html) prints the room name in uppercase framed by blank lines followed by the description, [print_menu_line()](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/jason/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-browser/workbench/workbench.html) formats individual exit options in the "Go DIRECTION to location" format, and [print_menu()](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/jason/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-browser/workbench/workbench.html) displays all available exits with appropriate headers and footers. Navigation and validation functions were implemented next: [exit_leads_to()](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/jason/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-browser/workbench/workbench.html) maps direction keys to actual room names through nested dictionary lookups, [is_valid_exit()](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/jason/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-browser/workbench/workbench.html) validates whether a player's input matches an available exit, [menu()](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/jason/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-browser/workbench/workbench.html) creates a loop that continuously prompts the player until a valid exit is entered, and [move()](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/jason/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-browser/workbench/workbench.html) returns the actual room dictionary object for the chosen direction. Finally, the [main()](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/jason/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-browser/workbench/workbench.html) function ties everything together in an infinite game loop that displays the current room, retrieves available exits, prompts the player and validates their input, and updates the current room based on their choice. The entire system relies on nested dictionaries where rooms reference each other by identifier keys, enabling fluid movement throughout the game world while maintaining clean, reusable code structure.
